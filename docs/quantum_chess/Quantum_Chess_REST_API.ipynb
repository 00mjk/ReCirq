        "#Quantum Chess in Cirq\n",
        "Quantum Chess is a variant of chess that gives players access to extra moves which allow them to create superposition. All moves are applied to the game state via unitary evolution, allowing players to experience effects like superposition, entanglement, and interference. This project provides a limited implementation of the full Quantum Chess move set, executed on a set of qubits representing squares. Quantum Chess defines REST API, that gives the game the ability to offload the quantum state of the board to an external resource. In this notebook we will explore an implementation of this API, using the code from this project. For more information on how the actual Quantum Chess on Cirq implementation works, including details on qubit mapping and error correction, see the documentation here.\n",

        "The ascii board is a convenience that can be used for testing the project imports.  The Quantum Chess REST API defines the interface, which used by the Quantum Chess Engine to assign an external resource to handle the quantum state of the game. This state encodes only the \"occupancy\" of each square on the board. Each square is mapped to a single qubit, where the state |1> corresponds to the square being occupied by a piece, and |0> is unoccupied. All piece type information, and rules checking, is handled classically within the Quantum Chess Engine. When implementing the API, we only neeed to use the CirqBoard. The following code shows how to initialize a CirqBoard with a single \"piece\" in square a1, and introduces a helper function to print out the probability distribution, and some diagnostic information from the instance of CirqBoard.\n"
